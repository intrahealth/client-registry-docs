This is a community project and meant for others to adopt to their use cases as they wish. What Does It Do? \u00b6 A Client Registry holds patient identifers and may include patient demographic information. It is a necessary tool for public health use cases that require managing patients, monitoring outcomes, and conducting case-based surveillance. This Client Registry is an open source and open standards-based implementation that offers the ability to: Assign and look-up unique identifiers, Allow connections from diverse point of service (POS) systems, such as electronic medical record (EMR) systems, that can submit messages in FHIR, and Configure decision rules around patient matching. Caution This implementation does not allow point-of-service systems to get patient demographic information stored in the Client Registry. This is also not a Shared Health Record, nor does it contain patient clinical data. Use Cases \u00b6 The Client Registry is one component in a more complex HIS architecture needed to accomplish important use cases, such as: Deduplicating patients : Sometimes patients have multiple diagnostic results stored within a POS. The Client Registry will link patients based on configurable decision rules so multiple test results for the same patient can be found. Tracking patients lost to clinical care : EMRs are often not interoperable with one another, resulting in difficulty tracking patients as they move between facilities to seek care. A Client Registry will help data managers to track patients, decreasing instances of duplicate and incomplete records, patients LTFU, and sub-optimal care. Caution The Client Registry is not deduplicating or even touching patient clinical and demographic records within point-of-service systems. Instead, it provides a way to enable use cases like deduplication - which must be an external process. Workflows \u00b6 Architecture \u00b6 The Client Registry is not one application, instead it's a set of applications that work together in the Open Health Information Exchange (OpenHIE) architecture to serve point-of-service systems, like EMRs, insurance mechanisms, and labs. Caution This is not an OpenHIE product. It is a prototypical client registry to facilitate discussion among a broad set of stakeholders. The architecture is made up of: The Open Health Information Mediator (OpenHIM) : The OpenHIM is the entrypoint for POS systems, and includes authentication (are you who you say you are?), authorization (what roles do you have permission to fulfill?), and auditing of all transactions. The HAPI FHIR Server : HAPI is the reference FHIR server in Java and scalable into production environments. The ElasticSearch : Elasticsearch is a powerful search engine that is highly performant. An optional UI to view and break matches between records, and to select and chain together decision rules around matching algorithms.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"#overview","text":"Welcome!

The purpose of the Client Registry is to link patients in different systems, but not to transfer any data, neither clinical records nor demographic data. Caution The Client Registry does not store clinical information. Having the Client Registry enables the ability to create a Shared Health Record in the future. The Client Registry stores the patient demographic data submitted to it in queries. The Client Registry stores demographic data at least in the HAPI FHIR Server, which can have any database backend an implementer chooses to use. ElasticSearch (ES) is an optional search engine, and requires configuration. ES can also store patient data fields selectably. JSON files are used to configure the system. Later iterations will support environment variables and a graphical interface. See https://github.com/openhie/client-registry/tree/master/server/config for example configuration files discussed here. Deciding Between a Standalone or Mediator Configuration \u00b6 A central application is the Client Registry Service, as distinct from the larger Client Registry platform. There are two options for running the application, as an OpenHIM mediator or as standalone application. Choose running the app standalone when: For testing, demonstration, or development environments. There are few clients that will connect to managing client authentication and roles will not be a burden. There is no need for an additional layer of auditing. Choose running the app as a mediator when: For production. The central application should be run as a mediator registered in OpenHIM. There are many clients that will need to connect. There is a need to audit transactions. There is an existing health information exchange layer or OpenHIM. One advantage of using the OpenHIM interface is the ability to change settings like the FHIR server. Security and Privacy \u00b6 Many configuration options relate to privacy and security. These steps are critical to address. Whether in standalone or as a mediator, the Client Registry must interact only with known, trusted clients with TLS certificates. Clients must be registered and certificates assigned to them. In standalone mode, the server runs TLS by default, and requires signed certificates. Client certificate needs can be turned off in OpenHIM when running as a mediator and this feature must be regularly audited to ensure security. Connecting Services \u00b6 The default ports are as follows: 3000 : Client Registry Service 9200 : ElasticSearch 8080 : HAPI FHIR Server In server/config/config_development_template.json there is a template for configuration. Link to file Contents of server/config/config_development_template.json { \"app\" : { \"port\" : 3000 , \"installed\" : false }, \"mediator\" : { \"api\" : { \"username\" : \"root@openhim.org\" , \"password\" : \"openhim-password\" , \"apiURL\" : \"https://localhost:8080\" , \"trustSelfSigned\" : true , \"urn\" : \"\" }, \"register\" : false }, \"fhirServer\" : { \"baseURL\" : \"http://localhost:8080/clientregistry/fhir\" , \"username\" : \"hapi\" , \"password\" : \"hapi\" }, \"elastic\" : { \"server\" : \"http://localhost:9200\" , \"username\" : \"\" , \"password\" : \"\" , \"max_compilations_rate\" : \"10000/1m\" , \"index\" : \"patients\" }, \"structureDefinition\" : { \"reportRelationship\" : \"patientreport\" }, \"matching\" : { \"tool\" : \"mediator\" }, \"systems\" : { \"openmrs\" : { \"uri\" : \"http://clientregistry.org/openmrs\" }, \"dhis2\" : { \"uri\" : \"http://clientregistry.org/dhis2\" }, \"lims\" : { \"uri\" : \"http://clientregistry.org/lims\" }, \"brokenMatch\" : { \"uri\" : \"http://ihris.org/CR/brokenMatch\" } }, \"sync\" : { \"lastFHIR2ESSync\" : \"1970-01-01T00:00:06\" }, \"__comments\" : { \"matching.tool\" : \"this tells if the app should use mediator algorithms or elasticsearch algorithms for matching, two options mediator and elasticsearch\" } } General App Configuration \u00b6 app.port is the port the application will run on. app.installed can be left to True. This tells the Client Registry Service to load structure definitions into HAPI FHIR Server, otherwise it will not. Mediator App Configuration \u00b6 mediator.register to true if the application will run as a mediator. Or, to false if the app will run as standalone. mediator.api.xx settings are only if running as a mediator. mediator.api.username | password must be different. The existing settings are defaults and must be changed when configuring the OpenHIM. mediator.api.trustSelfSigned should be set to false in production or any sensitive environment. True is only for demonstrations. FHIR Server \u00b6 The currently supported FHIR version is R4. fhirServer.baseURL is the default. Note that it may change depending on the way HAPI is installed. It may, for example, default to a baseURL of http://localhost:8080/baseR4/. fhirServer.username | password must be changed from defaults in HAPI. ElasticSearch Configuration \u00b6 For ES, the relationship between patient resources in FHIR and what fields are synchronized in ES must be explicitly defined. This is termed the Report Relationship mapping. One must define what resource to be used (patient) and what fields need to be available in ES. After this, the Client Registry reads these fields, and populates ES with the information. OpenHIM Mediator JSON Configuration \u00b6 If using OpenHIM, it must be configured for proper clients and roles to accept and forward requests from the Client Registry. An example export of a working JSON configuration that can be imported for development purposes is available.

It is also recommended that the demographic data that is primarily stored in HAPI FHIR be indexed into Elasticsearch. For match processing, there are two options. One is run in mediator-only mode, which is highly flexible and supports a handful of algorithms that can be chained together. Additional algorithms can be added as needed. The second is to use ES. ES is very fast and supports compound queries but currently only supports Levenshtein distance. When using ES, every request to the FHIR Server is cached in ES. (One additional caveat for Levenshtein distance is that the mediator-only matching can support edit distances exceeding two, while ES edit distance cannot exceed two.) Every client wishing to use the Client Registry must be authenticated and authorized. See the configuration page for more information. How to Set Decision Rules \u00b6 Decision rules determine how matches are made among records, for example, by using a certain algorithm on one field and a different algorithm on another. Let's use the below example: rules.givenName is used as one rule on the field givenName. rules.givenName.algorithm defines an algorithm, in this instance Jaro-Winkler, and an threshold for that algorithm unique to it. rules.givenName.path is a required FHIRpath for the fields, a standard way to define how to traverse a FHIR resource. In future, a GUI may be used for defining the FHIRpath. By default, all of the rules are chained together in a logical AND statement. In ES the search queries are assembled into compound queries.

(One additional caveat for Levenshtein distance is that the mediator-only matching can support edit distances exceeding two, while ES edit distance cannot exceed two.) Every client wishing to use the Client Registry must be authenticated and authorized. See the configuration page for more information.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"decision_rules/#how-to-set-decision-rules","text":"Decision rules determine how matches are made among records, for example, by using a certain algorithm on one field and a different algorithm on another. Let's use the below example: rules.givenName is used as one rule on the field givenName. rules.givenName.algorithm defines an algorithm, in this instance Jaro-Winkler, and an threshold for that algorithm unique to it. rules.givenName.path is a required FHIRpath for the fields, a standard way to define how to traverse a FHIR resource. In future, a GUI may be used for defining the FHIRpath. By default, all of the rules are chained together in a logical AND statement. In ES the search queries are assembled into compound queries.

PKCS #12 is for storing several cryptographic objects together including user-defined values.

PKCS #12 is for storing several cryptographic objects together including user-defined values. In the provided example .p12 files in the Client Registry repository, they include an X.509 (public key) certificate and a private key, and some information about the owner, including, for the Client Registry, the subject , meaning the name of the system (such as a specfic EMR POS system) that it was issued for. A useful way to understand this better is to open one of the .p12 files using no password (hit enter) for the Import Password, and the subject name for the PEM pass phrase (in this example 'openmrs' without quotes and in lowercase). When certificate is self-signed, then issuer and subject field contains the same value # from client-registry/server/sampleclientcertificates $ openssl pkcs12 -info -in openmrs.p12 Enter Import Password: MAC Iteration 2048 MAC verified OK PKCS7 Encrypted data: pbeWithSHA1And40BitRC2-CBC, Iteration 2048 Certificate bag Bag Attributes localKeyID: 36 7A 50 BC 1C 0E 69 93 22 7F CC FB 4D 07 C2 BE B2 37 02 C6 subject = /CN = openmrs issuer = /CN = localhost/O = Client Registry -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- ... -----END CERTIFICATE----- PKCS7 Data Shrouded Keybag: pbeWithSHA1And3-KeyTripleDES-CBC, Iteration 2048 Bag Attributes localKeyID: 36 7A 50 BC 1C 0E 69 93 22 7F CC FB 4D 07 C2 BE B2 37 02 C6 Key Attributes: <No Attributes> Enter PEM pass phrase: Verifying - Enter PEM pass phrase: -----BEGIN ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY----- ... -----END ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY----- the p12 is normally protected with a password and is not shared. It is imported in an application (e.g. a browser or a password manager) When a authentication must take place, the browser sends the identification information and its public key. The server then offers a challenge only the owner of the private key can solve. The browsers then sends back the solution of the challenge and the user is both identified and authenticated. Anyone getting access to the p12 will be able to impersonate the real owner.","title":"Non-Production"},{"location":"troubleshooting/","text":"Troubleshooting \u00b6","title":"Troubleshooting"},{"location":"troubleshooting/#troubleshooting","text":"","title":"Troubleshooting"},{"location":"ui/","text":"Admin Interface \u00b6","title":"Admin Interface"},{"location":"ui/#admin-interface","text":"","title":"Admin Interface"},{"location":"workflow/","text":"Workflows \u00b6 This page is under construction and will be revised. Big picture \u00b6 The process for a point-of-service system like an EMR to get a unique ID from the Client Registry is straightforward though it looks complicated at first. Let's break this down. A POS provides some demographic information to the Client Registry. The Client Registry looks for an existing record matching that patient. If there is an existing record, the Client Registry provides the unique ID back to the POS. If there is not an existing record, the Client Registry makes a new one and provides a unique ID back to the POS. In Greater Detail \u00b6 When requests are submitted with demographic data in a FHIR message, the Client Registry reads an submitting system's ID of that patient. The Client Registry searches for that submitting system's ID in its records. This happens regardless if it is a new patient or update of existing patient. When the submitting system's ID matches an existing record, the Client Registry updates the patient demographic information of that record with changes submitted. Once the update is complete, the existing record linkages may affected. This is because algorithms may not continue to link records as before because details have changed. Therefore, the Client Registry will pool all patients that were previously matched and break all the matches. The Client Registry will rerun matching algorithms again to see what matches are currently true matches of the patient. Then the Client Registry will be updated with the true matches given the changes in demographic data. Another scenario is when the Client Registry searches and doesn't find anyone already with same submitting system's ID. If there is not existing match, the Client Registry runs the matching algorithms for existing patients who matches that patient and will provide record linkages with other records. Requirements \u00b6 In order for this process to work as expected, there are some requirements: Requests sent to the Client Registry must be made of FHIR messages. FHIR is a popular specification for accessing an API for providing data in health systems. Messages must support FHIR R4.","title":"Workflows"},{"location":"workflow/#workflows","text":"This page is under construction and will be revised.","title":"Workflows"},{"location":"workflow/#big-picture","text":"The process for a point-of-service system like an EMR to get a unique ID from the Client Registry is straightforward though it looks complicated at first.
